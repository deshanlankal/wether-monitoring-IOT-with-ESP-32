## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) / [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) / [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deshanlankal/wether-monitoring-IOT-with-ESP-32.git
   cd wether-monitoring-IOT-with-ESP-32
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.
